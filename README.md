# Homework : 

  As with the Hello World app -- it doesn't have to be fancy. Instead, the goal is to have everyone comfortable with building a multi-screen app from scratch.  In both iOS and Android, there's a controller (viewController or Activity) that handles the current screen, and it can get notifications/events that a screen is coming into view, or moving away.
  
  Something to think about -- many apps have a singleton object that holds data that is relevant to many different screens.  In Xcode, this could be the AppDelegate; Java has ways to do this too.  If you can, add something to your screens that shows persistent data across different views (i.e., be able to set a variable to a specific value in one view, and then have it display that value in a different view).

# The application idea : 
  This simple application generates two different screens with the name that you entered into Text Field.
